## Description 📄

A backend solution to run an e-commerce website using Node.js and Express.js. The platform's backbone is made up of this backend architecture, which combines with MySQL2 and Sequelize to manage database activities effectively. I've ensured a smooth and dependable data flow by utilizing the capabilities of these technologies, enabling efficient interactions between users and the program.

I've incorporated the dotenv package with additional security techniques to protect sensitive data, including API keys and database credentials. This strategy strengthens the platform's resistance against possible security breaches. The "e-commerce" database, which has been thoroughly organized with clear tables for goods, categories, and tags, is the system's brain. This company improves data retrieval and manipulation, which improves the user experience overall.
